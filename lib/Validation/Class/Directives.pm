# VERSION

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Validation::Class::Directives provides a collection of installed
Validation::Class directives. This class inherits from
L<Validation::Class::Mapping>. Please look at L<Validation::Class::Directive>
for information of developing your own directives.

=head1 RATIONALE

The following is a list of core directives that get installed automatically with
Validation::Class and can be used to jump-start your data validation initiative.
B<Please Note!> The purpose of the core directives is merely to provide a
reasonable layer of protection against bad/malformed data, the validators are
not very sophisticated and were created using a minimal level of strictness
(e.g. the email and hostname directives do not perform a hostname lookup nor
does the email directive conform to the RFC specification).

Various applications have varied levels of strictness regarding various types
of input (e.g. a hospital API may require a more sophisticated SSN validation
than that of a department of education API; likewise; an email service API may
require a more sophisticated email validation than that of a file sharing API).
Validation::Class does not attempt to provide validators for all levels of
strictness and the core directives exist to support typical use-cases with
a minimal level of strictness.
