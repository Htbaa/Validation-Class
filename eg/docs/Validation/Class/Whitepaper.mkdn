# NAME

Validation::Class::Whitepaper - Operate with Impunity

# VERSION

version 7.900000

# INTRODUCTION

This whitepaper will serves as a guide to help readers understand the common
data validation issues as well as the the rationale and various usage scenarios
for Validation::Class.

Data validation is an important aspect of every application yet it is often
overlooked or neglected. Data validation should be thought of as your data input
firewall, a layer that exist between the user of your application and the
application's business objects.

# DATA VALIDATION PROBLEMS

Typically when designing an application we tend to name input parameters in an
arbitrarily fashion and validate the same data at various stages during a
program's execution (duplicating logic and validation routines) in various
places in the application stack. This approach is inefficient and prone to bugs
and security problems.

# A DATA VALIDATION SOLUTION

A better approach to data validation is to first consider each parameter hitting
your application as a transmission fitting a very specific criteria and
construct a data validation layer that operates with that in mind
(e.g. exactly like a network firewall). Your data validation rules should act
as filters which will accept or reject and format the transmission for use
within your application.

# WHY VALIDATION::CLASS

Validation::Class is a flexible and powerful data validation framework. It
allows you to model data and construct objects with focus on structure,
reusability and data validation.

Its main purpose is to properly handle data input errors. Validation::Class
classes are designed to ensure consistency and promote reuse of data validation
rules.

Validation classes derived from Validation::Class are typically configured using
the Validation::Class sugar functions (or keywords). Validation classes are
typically defined using the following keywords:

    * field     - a data validation rule that matches an input parameter
    * mixin     - a configuration template which can be merged with a field
    * directive - a field/mixin rule corresponding to a directive class name
    * filter    - a custom filtering routine which transforms a field value
    * method    - a self-validating sub-routine w/ associated validation profile

A data validation framework exists to handle failures, it is its main function
and purpose, in-fact, the difference between a validation framework and a
type-constraint system is how it responds to errors.

There are generally two types of errors that occur in an application,
user-errors which are expected and should be handled and reported so that a user
can correct the problem, and system-errors which are unexpected and should cause
the application to terminate and/or handling the exception. Exception handling
is the process of responding to the occurrence, during computation, of
exceptions (anomalous or exceptional situations).

User errors and system errors are poplar opposites. It is not always desired
and/or appropriate to crash from a failure to validate user input.
